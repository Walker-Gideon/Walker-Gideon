👋 Hi, I’m @Walker-Gideon
I’m Gideon Awortwe, a Front-End Developer and Computer Science student at KNUST, passionate about crafting clean, user-friendly web experiences. I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS, with a knack for Motion Design to bring interfaces to life. I use Git for seamless version control. 🌟

👀 I’m interested in building intuitive web applications, exploring UI/UX design, and diving deeper into modern JavaScript frameworks.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced React techniques, Next.js, and how to optimize web performance for better user experiences.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, freelance web development gigs, or any creative tech ideas—let’s build something amazing together!
